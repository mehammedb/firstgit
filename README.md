*****what i grasp in usestate*****  
  
setState in class component and setter methon in useState hook are the same.
both executes in bach.  
if there are many setter method and if they receive the argument other than function, Only the last method will be executed.  
But if they receive function as argument, they execute all  
setter method in class component can merge but in useState you should do it manually  
newLine1


we can call components inside the callback function of map method, but with key property which can not be accessed in child component
